	<text auto="true" type="str" verify="true"><![CDATA[As travel returned this year, we ventured back into the world with a renewed sense of adventure. From Alaska’s Denali National Park and Reserve to Indonesia’s lush rainforests, the photographs we published in 2022 reflect the beauty of our world through fresh perspectives. 
Our National Geographic contributors were tasked with documenting the enduring essence of travel. They opened the aperture on innovative conservation efforts, vibrant cultural communities, and underappreciated destinations ready for future travel.
As we look to the new year, we hope these photographs ignite your adventurous spirit, encourage transformative experiences, and set you off on your next journey.
